<h2>Why BDK?</h2>
<p>The simplest way to integrate Bitcoin wallet features into any application</p>

<div class="features">
<div class="feature">
<h3>Multi-Language Support</h3>

We are building native API's for C, Swift, Java & Kotlin so you can easily integrate Bitcoin in your preferred programming language on mobile.

</div>

<div class="feature">
<h3>Descriptors</h3>

Through descriptors and miniscript we support generalized wallet spending conditions. This provides wallets with first class support for very complex spending policies, without having to individually translate them into code.

</div>

<div class="feature">
<h3>Custom Block Data Sources</h3>

Use a local full node, an SPV node, or your own Electrum or Esplora server with API access to source data about the blockchain. You choose exactly what's right for your project.

</div>

<div class="feature">
<h3>Cross Platform</h3>

The core logic is feature rich allowing you to build any wallet from scratch on mobile, desktop and even WebAssembly.
